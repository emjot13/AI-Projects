In this project I wanted to compare and test a few algorithms, in particular genetic algorithms that might be useful for solving 3SAT satisfiability 
problems in the 3CNF form.

I implemented the following algorithms:
- brute force
- DPLL - Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm
- 2 my own evolutionary algorithms
- PSO algorithm

Used libraries: PySwarms and PyGad.

The complete breakdown of all the steps and conslucions can be found in the PDF file (in Polish).
